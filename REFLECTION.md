Caffeine didn't help as much as I expected, honestly.

As for the actual reflection:
- I used Typescript here so I could abuse classes and enums better for the data, and avoid copies of the object. However, I've included a compiled JS version.
- Using my own data was mostly just a guess, as I don't really know how well I sleep.
- I was initially going to use a full Node project, but I realized that's a bit silly.
